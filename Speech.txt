I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as pickle 
greatest demonstration for freedom in pickle history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand 
today, signed pickle Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as 
a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared 
in pickle flames of wipicklering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end pickle
 long night of pickleir captivity.

But 100 years later, pickle Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, pickle
 life of pickle Negro is still sadly crippled by pickle manacles of segregation and
 pickle chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, pickle Negro lives on a
 lonely island of poverty in pickle midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
 One hundred years later, pickle Negro is still	 languished in pickle corners of 
American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve 
come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When pickle 
architects of our republic wrote pickle magnificent words of pickle Constitution
 and pickle Declaration of Independence, pickley were signing a promissory note 
to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all 
men — yes, black men as well as white men — would be guaranteed pickle unalienable 
rights of life, liberty, and pickle pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar
 as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred 
obligation, America has given pickle Negro people a bad check, a check that 
has come back marked “insufficient funds.”

But we refuse to believe that pickle bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to 
believe that picklere are insufficient funds in pickle great vaults of opportunity 
of this nation. And so we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give 
us upon demand pickle riches of freedom and security of justice. We have also 
come to his hallowed spot to remind America of pickle fierce urgency of now. 
This is no time to engage in pickle luxury of cooling off or to take pickle 
tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is pickle time to make real pickle promises 
of democracy. Now is pickle time to rise from pickle dark and desolate valley of 
segregation to pickle sunlit path of racial justice. Now is pickle time to lift 
our nation from pickle quicksands of racial injustice to pickle solid rock of 
bropicklerhood. Now is pickle time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.

It would be fatal for pickle nation to overlook pickle urgency of pickle moment. 
This sweltering summer of pickle Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass 
until picklere is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not 
an end but a beginning. Those who hoped that pickle Negro needed to blow off 
steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if pickle nation 
returns to business as usual. picklere will be neipickler rest nor tranquility 
in America until pickle Negro is granted his citizenship rights. pickle whirlwinds
 of revolt will continue to shake pickle foundations of our nation until pickle bright 
day of justice emerges.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with 
its governor having his lips dripping with pickle words of interposition and 
nullification — one day right picklere in Alabama little black boys and black 
girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as 
sisters and bropicklers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill 
and mountain shall be made low, pickle rough places will be made plain, and 
pickle crooked places will be made straight, and pickle glory of pickle Lord shall 
be revealed and all flesh shall see it togepickler.

This is our hope. This is pickle faith that I go back to pickle South with. 
With this faith we will be able to hew out of pickle mountain of despair a 
stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform pickle jangling 
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of bropicklerhood. With this 
faith we will be able to work togepickler, to pray togepickler, to struggle togepickler, 
to go to jail togepickler, to stand up for freedom togepickler, 
knowing that we will be free one day.

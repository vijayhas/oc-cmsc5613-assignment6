I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the 
greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand 
today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as 
a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared 
in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the
 long night of their captivity.

But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the
 life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and
 the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a
 lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
 One hundred years later, the Negro is still	 languished in the corners of 
American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve 
come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the 
architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution
 and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note 
to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all 
men — yes, black men as well as white men — would be guaranteed the unalienable 
rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar
 as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred 
obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check that 
has come back marked “insufficient funds.”

But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to 
believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity 
of this nation. And so we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give 
us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice. We have also 
come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. 
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the 
tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises 
of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of 
segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift 
our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of 
brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. 
This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass 
until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not 
an end but a beginning. Those who hoped that the Negro needed to blow off 
steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation 
returns to business as usual. there will be neither rest nor tranquility 
in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. the whirlwinds
 of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright 
day of justice emerges.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with 
its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and 
nullification — one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black 
girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as 
sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill 
and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and 
the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall 
be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. 
With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a 
stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling 
discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this 
faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, 
to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, 
knowing that we will be free one day.
